#Neovim setup

##Things to install
*Packer
*telescope
*neovim-treesitter
*nightfox theme

##How it all gels together?

*init will load basics like lua/lastek and packer
* dir 'after' contains the stuff thats auto-loaded after everything else is done loading
*'after' also has some custom mappings inside telescope.lua
*my 'lastek' config contains an init that loads packer and custom remap func
